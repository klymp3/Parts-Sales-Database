To work, connect the database files from folder "DataBaseFiles" to your MS server.
After in the project, in "Classes/DataBase/datab.cs" you need to change the connection signal to yours.
Unfortunately, I was unable to implement the connection through the files, the difference in sql did not allow me to do this.
